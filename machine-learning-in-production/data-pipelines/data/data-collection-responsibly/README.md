# Responsible Data

For example, a picture of weddings from around the world might visually look different in a picture. If we are going to classify wedding images, we need to make as much effort to source an unbiased data set.

Data security that really refers to the policies and methods and means to secure personal data or what's often referred to as PII, Personally Identifiable Information. Data privacy is about proper usage, collection retention, deletion and storage of that data.

"you are a steward of your data"

it's important to establish mechanisms to prevent your system revealing a user's data inadvertently or even through a tax
Aggregation really helps with that if you can aggregate the data so that you can identify individual people within it, anonymous, rising it and giving users control over what data they share. 

## How can ML system fails

ML Systems can fail users in a lot of different ways and we need to strike a balance between being fair and accurate and transparent and explainable

- Representational harm is where a system will amplify or reflect a negative stereotype about particular groups. 
- Opportunity denial is when a system makes predictions that have negative real life consequences that could result in lasting impacts. 
- Disproportionate product failure is where the effectiveness of your model is really skewed so that the outputs happen more frequently for particular groups of users, you get skewed outputs more frequently essentially can think of as errors more frequently
- Harm by disadvantage is where a system will infer disadvantageous associations between different demographic characteristics and the user behaviors around that. 

"Fairness is important and you should really commit to it from the beginning."

## ML systems can apmplify bias
To reduce bias, you need accurate labels.
1. automated systems
	- 
1. human raters "Raters"
	- could be generalists adding labels using crowd sourcing tools
	- could be experts diagnosing xrays
	- users can also provide feedback

Data freshness needs to be considered to manage collection responsibly
