# Sensors and signals

Signals are sequences of data collected from real time sensors
Each data point indexed by timestamp 
Sensors and signlas data is thus time series
Example: classify sequences of accelerometer data recorded by sensors on smartphone

## Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

- require segmentation operators
- inertial data from wearables fluctates greatly overtime
- features extraction, validation,
