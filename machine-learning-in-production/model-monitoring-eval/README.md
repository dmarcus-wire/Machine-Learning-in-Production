# Continuous monitoring and eval

Why do models need to be monitored?
1. Training data is a snapshot of the world at a point in time
2. many types of data change over time
3. unlike wine, models do not get betters with age

Data Drift and Shift
1. concept drift
   1. can happen when data doesn't change (think popular styles change)
   2. emerging concepts are new relations not previously present
